This homework is pretty easy compare to the former.May be i am familiar with hadoop testing.It`s really convinent to use local test!It is more likely to ask us to use the right way professor told us on class.During the homework, I find there are many points in the slides i didnt pay attention to.With the assignment`s help,I finally find them.I`m worry about exam now as it may different like coding,many details of the hadoop I do not pay attention there.It will be a hard time for preparing midterm.
