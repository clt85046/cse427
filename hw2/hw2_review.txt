I think hw2 is easier than hw1.
Porblem 1 and 2 is a review for lab 1 and things we learn on class.It is not so hard to solve with the slide on the website.And by communicate with my teammates we can make the answer more correctly i think.
Problem 3 really like the question mentioned on class,I feel question a and b looks really similar.This is my first work finish with my parter,I hope i can get a good grade.
