It is really  not an easy homework.
Problem 1 have no correct answer,and what dimension confused me at first,by reading the introductionslides it make me better,but still not sure what is the better word to conclude properties.
And problem 2 is easier for me to work as I can check my answer with the table.
But the problem 3 is hard for me.It takes me a long time to read the artical,there are little words can directly answer the question and I have few experience doing this type problem.Im not sure about which kind of answer seem available.
Problem 4 is not very hard,with the introduction in MMDS and slides we can work it out.
However i have try my best to do this work for several days,i hope it can get a good result.
