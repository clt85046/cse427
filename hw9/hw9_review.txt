Hw9 is a little bit harder than the former homework.For the problem 1(a),it is easy to use two drivers to solve the problem.But it take me some time to find how to combine them in one driver.By doing  this problem,it helps me understand the different between hadoop1.0 and hadoop 2.0 like job and JobConf.Also,it is a review of the knowledge we had learned in this semester.And now I feel pig is really a good scripts compare to the mapreduce , I feel really convinent do the problem 1(b). And for the rest problem,I find less information on slides,I hope they can be write and give me a better score :-D¡£
