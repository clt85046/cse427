Hw7 is easier than before.Most work can be easily done with the help of slides.The script is easier than java.Also,test on local is really convenient.But the running time is longer than the former mapreduce job i think.The most difficult part in this work is the right order of the data schema,a wrong order may leads a wrong answer.At first,I cannot find out the answer of problem 1,because I make a wrong order in last lab.This tells me it is very important to pay attention to the details.
