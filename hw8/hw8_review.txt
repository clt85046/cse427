problem 3 takes me lots of time.It is easy to make a mistake when writing the srcipts about the orders and products.And at first,I was really confused about why platinum member is much more larger than other.Finally I found it was because the price in represent in cent,so the sum need to divide by 100,this answer seem much more normal in common sense.And for problem4 ,it used python scripts,I haven`t learn python before,but now I think I should spend some time to learn it.
